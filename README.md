# Stockfish Vision

Stockfish Vision is a chess analysis tool that suggests the best move based on the current chessboard state. It captures the board using screen capture or image upload, detects the board state using computer vision (OpenCV), and analyzes moves using the Stockfish chess engine. The program supports real-time and static image input, automatically converts board images to FEN strings, and provides move suggestions through a universal chess interface.
